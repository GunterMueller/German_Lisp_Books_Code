Examples and Exercises of the Book  "Einfuehrung in das Programmieren in Lisp, 2te. Auflage" from Christian-Michael Hamann. Walter de Gruyer, 1985 ( in German)

All examples were written in SIEMENS Interlisp V 4.0 on a SIEMENS Mainframe 7.541 running BS 2000 ( V 7.1) .
The Interlisp Interpreter LISPF4 ( https://github.com/GunterMueller/LISPF4.git ) is a good Implementation for Interlisp and all exampled did either run unchanged or where ported to this implementation.

After that all Interlisp code  will get ported to Common Lisp using the CLisp  Common Lisp Implementation. ( https://clisp.sourceforge.io/ )
